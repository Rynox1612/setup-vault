# 📘 Mongoose Info

## 🧠 What is Mongoose?

> **Mongoose** is an **Object Data Modeling (ODM)** library for **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.

It is **not MongoDB itself**, but a **package** that helps you interact with MongoDB easily by providing:
- A schema-based solution
- Model definition
- Built-in validation
- Middleware support
- Query building and chaining

Mongoose internally **uses MongoDB as its database**, but provides a more structured and developer-friendly way to work with it.
